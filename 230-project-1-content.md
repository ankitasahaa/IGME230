## Story
The main character is a hunter trying to track animals and decides to use a different trail on this particular day. It is a beautiful day outside as the birds sing and the leaves softly crunch underneath his feet. On his way, he shoots some animals with his arrow and finds some pages from a journal along the way. Piecing them together, he slowly finds out about some creatures in Brazilian mythology but thinks nothing of it. Some creatures he encounters along the way are the Saci-pererê, Mula Sem Cabeça, and Boitata. The Saci-pererê is a one-legged teenager with holes in his palms who wears a red cap and smokes a pipe. The red cap is special to him because it can make him disappear. If the hunter is able to capture him, the creature grants him wishes. His other ability is being able to transform into a Matitaperê, an elusive bird whose song seems to come from nowhere. The Mula Sem Cabeça is the ghost of a woman who has been cursed by God, condemned to turn into a fire-spewing headless mule, galloping from Thursday’s sundown to Friday’s sunrise. To remove her curse, the hunter must remove her birdle or if he wants to hide, he must lay face down on the ground, covering his teeth, nails, and anything else that shines. The Boitata is a great serpent of fire that the hunter must defeat in order to pass the stream. At the end of the trail, the hunter finds a cabin with footprints coming out of it. Assuming no danger is present he opens the door to find the Curupira, a boy with flame-colored hair and backwards feet. Instantly the mood of the game changes to a darker atmosphere as the hunter has to run back home. All the beautiful trees he had passed on his journey had lost their illusions and were instead twisted, worn-down trees. The grass is rotten and instead of hearing birds chirping, he hears the sound of screaming. When he reaches his cabin, the Curupira finds him and the hunter has to defeat him.

## Esthetics
The graphics are photorealistic to emphasize the pretty scenery. There will be no music to the Curupira’s cabin, but sounds found in nature so simulate the hunting experience. On the way back, there will be an ominous sound through the whole part and darker sounds.

## Gameplay
There will be progression dynamic since the player will know how many journal entries there are and will try to reach that number. To go left or right, the player must press the left and right arrows respectively. Spacebar is jump, down arrow is crouch, and shift is shoot.
